# Assignment1
Hi, I am Rayanh Almutairi 

I am  a Computer Science student at Imam Abdulrahman University.  
I have a strong interest in technology, coding, and especially machine learning.  
I am excited to learn how ML models work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in this course!
